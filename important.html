<h1>We attempted to do the Impossible</h1>
<p>Hello whoever is grading this. Keep in mind that this project uses a Redux cast so that we could create the YouTube app to qualify for completion of the project. We tried to build an ethereum contract on the blockchain that encrypted messages with a special RSA encryption method. Although the python script for the RSA algorithm was coded from scratch by Kartar, Winston was unable to engineer the front-end and program the solidity code necessary to deploy the cipher text on the block chain. Never the less, the code in the components of the YouTube React App and index.js is all Winston's code. In test.py, you can see Katar Singh's and Tadeusz Chabowski's work. Winston also put together news.html and newsCSS.html, which all combined totals about a thousand lines of code. All in all, we were very happy in attempting a project of this magnitude, and hope to continue working on this project outside of class.
Thank you for reading this!
Sincerely,
all participating group members.</p>
